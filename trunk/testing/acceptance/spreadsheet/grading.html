<h3>
    Acceptance Test Plan: Grading a Spreadsheet (James Fazio)
</h3>
<p>
    Before doing this Acceptance Test, create a Class with a default Grading Scheme and a
    grace day Late Policy with 3 grace days. Then Add two categories, 'Homework' for 30% of the class
    and 'Tests; for 70% of the class. Then add 3 Assignments under Homework. 'HMW1' for 30%, 'HMW2'
    for 40% and 'HMW3' for 50%. Add 2 Tests under Tests, 'Test1' for 60% and 'Test2' for 40%. Make
    all assignments out of 100 pts. Also Download a roster so students are in the class.
    The test plan for grading a spreadsheet course is as following:
