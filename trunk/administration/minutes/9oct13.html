Discussion of Current Milestone 2 Work and Q&A
<ul>
<li> 	It's ok to focus on just the teacher's persepective for this milestone. </li>
<li>	He likes menu bars because it is a natural way to organize functionality. </li>
<li>	Redundancy is Ok in the sense that there can be multiple ways to get to same screen/result within system. </li>
<li>	We need a way to get to the stats and graphs from the main spreadsheet. </li>
<li>	Show numeric stats (mean, median, st dev, etc.) at bottom of spreadsheet in a "drawer" that is open and closable. </li>
<li>	Customer is a big fan of multiple ways to view same data if they each offer something new or different. </li>
<li> 	Maybe we should split up grpahics page to allow lots of room for it, we don't want it to be squished. </li>
<li>	In Add Assignment window, there should be no preexisting categories for assignments, all types are created by user at some point. </li>
</ul>
