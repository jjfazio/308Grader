Feature discussion with customer
<ul>
<li>
Do you want a login or authentication screen?
<br>
No, not really. There should be an authentication in order to download roster(s) but not in general for an instructor.
<li>
How does it look "driving up"?
<br>
Maybe there should be a popup window with a list of an insstructor's classes to select from. This could be "intelligent" so it knows based on date which class(es) to show. The spreadsheet is empty to start for a class. 
<li>
Student electronic handin is an essential feature.
<br>
<li>
There should be a menu bar (or some other easy way) to add/edit/delete students, assignments, etc.
