Q & A with customer
<ul>
<li>
What is the overall navigation and flow like?
<br>
There isn't really a flow, it is more of a spreadsheet and tabs with menu(s) and dialogue boxes.
<li>
How will the data be stored, located, and accessed?
<br>
It can be accessed from anywhere but changes will only come from local.
<li>
Do you want an ability to override grades?
<br>
Yes, not all teachers will use this but it should be an available functionality.
<li>
Do you want email notifications?
<br>
Yes, that could be included. On a related note, there should be some sort of notification system for student users.
<li>
Are there more users than students and teachers?
<br>
Yes, there are also TA's and graders. Students will be enrolled in the class, or students with general campus wide access.
<li>
Should there be a tutorial for new users?
<br>
No, there should be some predictive help built in, but that will be discussed later.
