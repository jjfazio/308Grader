        <td valign=top>The 'View Graphs' window is the main focus for M3.
        <td valign=top>All files in implementation/controller/graph, implementation/model/graph, implementation/view/graph
        <td valign=top>After selecting a particular assignment column, click on the 'View Graphs' button below the table.
        <td valign=top>Toggling the 'View Grades As' check boxes on the Graph and Adjust Curves page should make graphs disappear and reappear. Different graphs should appear for different assignments that are selected on the main page. However, this assumes that the different columns and sub-columns in the table have been implemented, and there is data in the table. Since assignments have not yet been added to the main spreadsheet, test data had to be sent to the Graph and Adjust Curve page. However, the Graph and Adjust Curve class is still dynamic in the sense that whatever assignment / student list is passed to it will be displayed by the graphs. To prove this, I printed the test data before the Graph and Adjust Curve Controller was called. So before you look at the Graph and Adjust Curve page, look at the test data printed to System.out, and verify that this data is being displayed int the Graphs.
