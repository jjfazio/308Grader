1.5.3.  Flubaroo
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Flubaroo is a grading tool integrated with Google Docs. While not the most popular grading tool on the market, Flubaroo is simple to use and has many handy features. Flubaroo is free to the public, and can be installed and ready to use in a matter of minutes.
<p>
Overall, Flubaroo is a subpar grading tool. Students do not have an interface to view their graded work, and Flubaroo relies on Google Docs to store the grades.
<p>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bad Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Students only way of seeing grades is through email notifications
<li>
Only visual representation of grade distribution is a simple histogram in the grader's report
<li>
Flubaroo sends an email using your email address (some may find this concerning)
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Missing Features:</strong>
