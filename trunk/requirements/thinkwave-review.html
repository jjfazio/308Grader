1.5.6.  ThinkWave
</h4>
</a>
<p>
ThinkWave is a free online grading tool. The ease of use is attractive for simple grading, making it an excellent tool for elementary and middle school teachers. Thinkwave has a nice graphical interface with straightforward navigation. The Grading tool requires more of a sophisticated and customizable grading procedure. Most importantly ThinkWave lacks grade curving functionality and statistical breakdowns of assignments. 
<p>
Overall, Thinkwave provides a decent level of grading functionality with a clean interface.
