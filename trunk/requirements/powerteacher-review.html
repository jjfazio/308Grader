1.5.5.  PowerTeacher

<p>
PowerTeacher is a multi-platform classroom management system created by Pearson. It works with PowerSchool: a web-based student information system, to connect with ten million students in all fifty states and sixty-five countries. PowerSchool can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on external variables (funding, district, etc...). Because PowerTeacher supports multiple platforms, it leaves teachers/professors untethered from their desktop and laptop and allows them to record scores and make observations while moving around the classroom, gym, playground, lab or even field trips.
