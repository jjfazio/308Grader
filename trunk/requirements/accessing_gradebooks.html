			<p>The first row of the grade book is designated for assignment names (fields). The second row is designated for the student's personal scores and will be signified with a different shade of gray. The last two column is the students overall grade in the course represented both in precentage and letter grade. The rest of the rows are the grades of the student's classmates.
