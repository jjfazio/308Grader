At the top of the window a title is shown so the user can confirm that they are looking at the statistics and graphs for the correct assignment/quiz//test. There are three distinct parts that make up the functionality of the stats and graph view. The scores for an assignment are visually represented in a <a href="view_graphs.html">graphical representation</a> such as a bar chart of a pie chart. Secondly, there is a <a href="view_stats.html">statistical chart</a> showing the breakdown for the assignment/quiz/test. Lastly, there are buttons which will allow you to <a href="adjust_curves.html">adjust the curve</a> of the assignment.
