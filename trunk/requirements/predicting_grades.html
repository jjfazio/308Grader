		<div style="width: 800px; margin: auto;">
			<p>The predictor works in three ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Predicting remaining scores based on the kind of final grade the student wants.</li>
				<li>Fill up a few remaining scores and let the rest of the scores be averaged and predict a final grade.</li>
				<li>Fill in what the student thinks he/she will get for all assignments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All the predictor does is fill in empty fields. By having certain fields empty the predictor will understand what fields to predict.</p>
