<br>

At the top of the window a title is shown so the user can confirm that they are looking at the statistics and graphs for the correct assignment. Below The title are two graphs to give a visual representation of the grade distribution. On the actual tool, a line graph will substitute in for the bar chart. Below the two graphs is a grid displaying all of the different statistics for the given assignment/quiz/test. The statistics given are as follows: average, median, range, low score, high score, and standard deviation.

To the right of the statistics section is a button to adjust the curve of the given assignment/quiz/exam. When the button is clicked, the following view appears.

<hr>
<a name="Curve Adjustment View">

</a>
<br>

The grader will be able to manually enter a percentage (positive or negative) to adjust the curve of the assignment/quiz/exam. Also, a text box below the manual entry of the curve reminds the user that they can drag the curve of the graph in a horizontal direction to adjust the curve. Below that are two buttons, a cancel button to cancel the user's action of creating a curve, or a submit button which will save the adjusted curve and all the students grade after the curve.
