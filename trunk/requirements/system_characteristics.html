Security & Privacy
</p>


Security and privacy are important aspects of the grader. All parts of the tool involve both security and privacy. In the most basic terms, students' grade information is private and protected by University policies. Instructors have the ability to view and edit students' grades. The privacy part comes into play for other student users, though because students can not see grading information associated with a specific student. For example, it is acceptable for students to see grades for the whole class roster, but only if no students are identifiable. At no time is student's personal information available for other student users. Security is essential to instructors' interaction with SIS. This includes downloading rosters, posting grades, and syncing rosters. These transactions must be secure because of the private nature of the data.

Simplicity versus Power Specturm
</p>

The grader tool is aimed towards the simple end of the simplicity versus power specturm. Grade entry for instructors is as simple as clicking and typing in a cell. From a student's perspective, the tool is even more simple because they can only view grades. The statistics and graphs features of the tool are more sophisticated, but the visual aspect is naturally more intuitive for some users. Overall, the tool is built and designed for simplicity and ease of use.
