2.6.1 Graph View
</h4>

<p>
When in the Stats and Graphs view, the grader has an option to see the grade breakdown in a bar chart or a pie chart. The grader can select the type of chart in a radio group seen in Figure 2.6.1 A.

The grader will click on the radio button <tt>'Bar Chart'</tt> to see a bar chart view, or on  <tt>'Pie Chart'</tt> to see a pie chart view. If the grader selects <tt>'Bar Chart'</tt>, the grader must then choose between having between 1% or 10% granularity for the grades in the chart. After the grader selects the type of graph, they press the <tt>'Refresh Graph'</tt> button to have the type of graph be updated. Figures 2.6.2 B and 2.6.2 C show what the bar chart looks like, and Figure 2.6.2 D shows what the pie chart looks like to the grader.

The figure above shows the number of students who received each letter grade, allowing the grader to have a visual idea of the grade distribution for that assignment/quiz/test. The above figure has 10% intervals, where as in Figure 2.6.1 C below there are 1% invervals.

<br>
The figure above is similar to Figure 2.6.1 B, but with 1% intervals instead of 10% intervals. The grader may prefer this view if they want to see specifically if there were more plus or minus grades for a certain letter grade.
