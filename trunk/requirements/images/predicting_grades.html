2.7.4  Predicting Grades 
</h3>
</a>
<h2>Grade Predictor</h2>
<p>
	At the bottom of the grade book there is a grade predictor. It appears the same as the row in the grade book except some of the fields are editable.

<p>
	There are four different scenarios the student can experience:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Predicting remaining scores based on the kind of final grade the student wants.</li>
	<li>Fill up a few remaining scores and let the rest of the scores be averaged and predict a final grade.</li>
	<li>Fill in what the student thinks he/she will get for all assignments.</li>
	<li>Warn the student if the grade the student wants is impossible to get.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The first row shows a blank grade predictor.</li>
	<li>The second row shows the grades needed for the remaining of the assignments in order to get a particular grade (B)</li>
	<li>The third row shows some grades that the students thinks he/she will get and lets the rest of the assignments be averaged to predict a grade.</li>
	<li>The fourth row warn the student that the grade wanted is impossible to get.</li>
	<li>The fifth row has the remaining assignment grades filled out by the student and predicts a grade.</li>

</ul>
