<p>
	The first row of the grade book is designated for assignment names (fields). The second row is designated for the student's personal scores. Hence, a different shade of gray. The last column is the students overall grade in the course. The rest of the rows are the grades of the student's classmates. The dashed lines are empty assignment slots which will be managed by the professor in <a href="manage_assignments_categories.html">Section 2.4</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Towards the Middle of the Course</h2>
<p>
	Towards the middle of the quarter/semester the professor has added assignments and grades for those assignments. When adding the assignment grades the final grade (Grade field/column) is automatically updated to reflect the overall grade in the course.

	The grid icon at the top of some assignment field signifies that the assignment can/have to be turned in electronically. The blue "View" link tells the student that he assignment is done and graded. The student can click on "View" and see his assignment submission. The green "Start" link tells the student that he/she hasn't started the assignment yet. The student can click on "Start" and begin the assignment. The yellow "Continue" link tells the student that he/she has views/submitted the assignment, but can resubmit/view it again. The student can click on "Continue" and start the assignment where he/she left off. When the column name is clicked the rows will be sorted in acceding order or descending order if clicked again.
