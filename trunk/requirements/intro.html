This document defines requirements for a Grader Tool. The tool provides functions for teachers to grade their classes and for both students and teachers to view grades along with the corresponding statistical breakdowns. Teachers are able to edit grading information locally and anyone with a valid login can access a read only version. 
<p>
In addition to providing useful functionality, the grader serves as a pedagogical example of software engineering concepts and principles. The software development artifacts for the Grader Tool are considered part of the overall Grader Tool package.
