End users fall into four categories. Teachers have classes and sections with enrolled students that they enter and maintain grades. Graders also enter grades for a teacher but they do not have the privilege of editing a class roster, which only a teacher can do. Enrolled students can view their own grades including specific assignment scores. Additionally, enrolled students can view all other enrolled studentsâ€™ scores in their class but cannot see the identifying information for each student such as name and ID. Students with campus access, but not enrolled in the class can also view class grades but not any specific student information. These students that are not enrolled will be interested in historical class results if they are considering enrolling in the class.

The primary customer is Gene Fisher. He is a customer representative for his faculty and staff colleagues in the Computer Science department at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. In this representative capacity, Fisher will consult with other potential customers to gather requirements from them, and integrate their requirements with his own.

The system developers are a team of six computer science and software engineering students. They are developing this project for a software engineering course. The students are: Kevin Backers, Kevin Feutz, Erik Owen, James Fazio, Steven Shaginyan, and Jirbert Dilanchian.
