1.5.4.  Microsoft Excel
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Microsoft Excel 2010 gives the ability to analyze, manage, and share information in a simple manner.  Excel uses a grid-like interface allowing the user to enter data in a linear and simple fashion.  Excel provides a surplus of functions that allow the user to manipulate and display the entered data.  Although Excel is not a dedicated grading tool, it still provides basic functionality as a grading tool for the user.
<p>
Overall, Excel provides an acceptable, but not desirable, use as a grading tool.  It does not support multi-platform use, since it is a Microsoft-only product.
