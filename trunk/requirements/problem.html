<p>
The general problems to be addressed by the Grader Tool project are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
To provide a reliable and easy to use software tool that manages grading of classes
<p> <li>
To provide a secure environment that instructors and teacher assistants can upload grades
<p> <li>
To give students the ability to view course grades without compromising their privacy.
</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and
public domain products, the Grader Tool provides a solution with certain
functional improvements over existing tools.  Specific problem areas are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Multi user access to data
<p> <li>
Providing a wide range of tools in a single software
<p> <li>
